# MHF - Memory Hard Functions

This package offers a single interface to common and standard memory-hard functions, also used as key derivation functions.
It completely relies on built-ins, so there's no change in implementations.

It's main intent is to offer abstraction of the underlying function and simply refer to it by an identifier, as well as to encode and back up a configuration of the parameters. 

Supported Memory-Hard Functions (or Key Derivation Functions are):
- Argon2 family
- Scrypt
- PBKDF2
